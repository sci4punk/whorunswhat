# WhoRunsWhat - Find out which tech stacks run at your favorite companies

This is the third project [Steve Englander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/recsci) worked on at [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com) in August, 2019

WhoRunsWhat currently runs on Heroku, and can be found here: http://whorunswhat.herokuapp.com/

**There is currently no pagination, and anytime someone searches, it automatically adds new companies to the database, so depending on when you go here and how many people have gone there previously, there might end up being a ton of companies in the database and the page may take quite a long time to load**

Once a few more features are added, it will be moved to it's new home at it's proper domain: whorunswhat.com

The WhoRunsWhat Google Chrome extension is planned for future development
